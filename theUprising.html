    <h3>History of the Syrian refugee crisis</h3>
    <div class="timeline-content">
    <h4>2010 — Syria is a modern society built on the cradle of civilization.</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Syria’s rich cultural history dates back more than 8,000 years. It is an economically fast-growing lower-middle-income country, according to the World Bank. Agriculture, industry, tourism, and oil are economic mainstays. Healthcare and primary and secondary education are free. (<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/syria/brief/the-toll-of-war-economic-and-social-impact-analysis-esia-of-the-conflict-in-syria-key-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find out how the war has damaged Syria’s social and economic systems.</a>) President <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/world/meast/bashar-al-assad---fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bashar al Assad</a> had succeeded his father as ruler.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="timeline-content">
    <h4>2011 — The Syrian civil war begins.</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>March: Peaceful protests in southern cities are met with violent crackdowns by Syrian security forces. Hopes of Arab Spring reforms are dashed by armed repression. Opposition groups organize but can’t seem to unite. International sanctions and other attempts to pressure the government to moderate are futile; its actions are met with defiance.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2012 — Syrians flee bombing and repression.</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Lebanon becomes a major destination for Syrian refugees. Many still hope they’ll return home soon.</li>
    <li><a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/FACTSHEET-ZaatariRefugeeCamp-Aug2017final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Za’atari refugee camp</a> opens in Jordan near the Syrian border. Though designed as a temporary settlement, it became home to tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who have stayed for years.</li>
    <li>August: <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2012/08/417632-syrian-government-and-opposition-forces-responsible-war-crimes-un-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syria has committed war crimes</a>, according to the U.N. Human Rights Council.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-content">
    <h4>2013 — Conflict increases as other countries join the fight.</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>March: Syrian refugees total 1 million.</li>
    <li>April: <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Timeline-of-Syrian-Chemical-Weapons-Activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chemical attacks are confirmed</a>. President Assad is accused of the attacks.</li>
    <li>September: Syrian refugees total 2 million.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-content">
    <h4>2014 — Humanitarian needs increase, but access to people in need becomes more difficult for aid groups.</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>April: Azraq camp opens in Jordan; 1 million refugees are now in Lebanon, estimated to be one quarter of the country’s population. The large number of refugees puts a severe strain on the nation’s social systems.</li>
    <li>June: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-lebanon/lebanon-near-breaking-point-over-syrian-refugee-crisis-pm-hariri-idUSKBN1722JM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISIL declares a caliphate</a> in Syria and Iraq’s occupied territory. Syrian refugees number 3 million in countries neighboring Syria; 100,000 people have reached Europe.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-content">

    <h4>2015 — Europe feels the pressure of Syrian refugees and migrants.</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Hungary erects a border wall, then closes their border with Serbia to stop refugees from entering Europe.</li>
    <li>The World Food Program cuts rations to refugees in Lebanon and Jordan due to a funding shortfall.</li>
    <li>September: The photo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/world/middleeast/alan-kurdi-aylan-anniversary-turkey-syria-refugees-death.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of 2-year-old Alan Kurdi (initially reported as Aylan Kurdi) shocks the world.</a> <a href="/refugees-news-stories/vinh-chung-reacts-syria-alan-kurdi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“That could have been me,” Dr. Vinh Chung told CNN’s Carol Costello of Alan Kurdi. “The body of the lifeless toddler, face down, washed up on the beach is really chilling to me — because that could have been me.”</a></li>
    <li>Thousands of refugees arrive daily in Greece; 1 million refugees reach Europe during 2015.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-content">
    <h4>2016 — Syria is devastated by years of war.</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>February: U.S. and Russian delegates negotiate a temporary cessation of hostilities, sanctioned by the U.N., to send aid to hard-to-reach populations in Syria.</li>
    <li>June: Tens of thousands of Syrian refugees are trapped in no-man’s-land when Jordan closes the border after a car bombing (<a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2018/1/8/jordan-agrees-to-one-off-aid-drop-to-stranded-syrians" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 55,000 remain there in 2018</a>).</li>

    <ul>
    <li>March: More than 5 million people have fled conflict in Syria.</li>
    <li>April: 58 people are killed in suspected nerve gas attack.</li>
    <li>July: A ceasefire is brokered at the G20 meeting for southwest Syria. Clashes are ongoing in Dara, ar Raqqa, Homs, and Hama governorates and Deir Ezzor city. More than 900,000 Syrians have been displaced this year.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="timeline-content">
    <h4>2018 — Humanitarian aid is limited as conflict continues.</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Fighting continues, despite international agreements for de-escalation.</li>
    <li>Humanitarian access is limited because of insecurity, and 2.9 million people remain in hard-to-reach areas where aid is not supplied on a regular basis.</li>
    <li>March 15: Syria enters the eighth year of the Syrian civil war.</li>
